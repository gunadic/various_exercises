Game of Life, MonteCarlo and QuickSort are all parallel processing projects comparing sequential java implementations to those written in OpenMP and MPI

The first is an implementation of Peterson's algorithm (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peterson's_algorithm)

The second uses Pthread mutex functions to deal with the problem.
